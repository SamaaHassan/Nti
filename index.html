        <p class="pargraph1">My hobbies center around three main activities:<b><span class="spanclass"> reading</span> , <span class="spanclass">traveling</span> ,and <span class="spanclass">meditation</span> </b>
            <br>
            <i>Reading</i> is my gateway to exploring new worlds and ideas, 
            while <i>traveling</i> fuels my passion for discovering the beauty of nature and different cultures.
            <i>Meditation</i> serves as my peaceful retreat, where I find calmness and mental clarity. 
            Together, these hobbies enrich my life and help shape who I am.</p>
